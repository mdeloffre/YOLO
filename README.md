# YOLO
Reimplementation of the YoloV1, V2 and V3 models for object detection &amp; classification. This project was made with Lucie Aldebert, Charles Martel and Pierre-Emmanuel Savoie.

This notebook was created for the final project of the INF8225 class. The idea was to find an existing method using ML and NN and reimplement it, or a part of it. We decided to go and choose the frist 3 iterations of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model; YoloV1, YoloV2 and YoloV3.

You can find more details about this project on the report file found in the repository.
